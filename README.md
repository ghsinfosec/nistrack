# NISTrack
This is a project I've wanted to do for some time. The goal of NISTrack is to give you a way to get started using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and help you to track your organization's NIST-CSF profile at a basic level. The amount of information in NIST publications can make your head spin, but in general the idea is to understand your organization's cybersecurity posture using Implementation Tiers to measure its effectiveness.

Use the Implementation Tiers to determine your Current Profile (i.e. what you're currently doing regarding NIST-CSF categories/subcategories), then identify what your Target Profile is (i.e. where you'd like to be).

There are a lot of resources for NIST-CSF on [their website](https://nist.gov/cyberframework). NISTrack is not a replacement for any of those resources! So don't skip out on these resources!

This README will be updated as I build it. I'm starting the whole project from zero with no developer experience, so this should be fun...

## Todo

- [ ] Fix definition display
- [ ] Authenticated "dashboard" area
- [ ] Login/auth mechanism

More will be added as I think of things.
